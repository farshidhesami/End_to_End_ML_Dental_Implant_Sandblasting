# End_to_End_ML_Dental_Implant_Sandblasting
The aim is to develop an end-to-end machine learning (ML) system that predicts the optimal sandblasting conditions for dental implants based on experimental data. This system will help in designing implants with improved surface roughness and cell viability, which are crucial for osseointegration and implant success.
