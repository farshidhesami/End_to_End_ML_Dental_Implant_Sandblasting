# End-to-End ML Dental Implant Sandblasting

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop an end-to-end machine learning (ML) system that predicts the optimal sandblasting conditions for dental implants based on experimental data. This system helps in designing implants with improved surface roughness and cell viability, which are crucial for osseointegration and implant success.

## Key Components
1. **Data Inputs**:
   - **Sandblasting Conditions**: Angle, Pressure
   - **Acid Etching Conditions**: Temperature, Time
   - **Anodizing Conditions**: Voltage, Time

2. **Prediction Metrics**:
   - **Average Surface Roughness (Sa)**
   - **Cell Viability (%)**

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create polynomial features to capture interactions between the original features.
4. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models on the training data.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the models using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models on the test set.
7. **Predictions**: Make predictions on new data and visualize the results.

## Model Choices
### Linear Models
1. **Ridge Regression**:
   - **Why Used**: Handles multicollinearity by adding L2 regularization, reducing model sensitivity to specific training data.
   
2. **RidgeCV**:
   - **Why Used**: Automates the process of finding the best regularization parameter using cross-validation, optimizing model performance.

3. **ElasticNet**:
   - **Why Used**: Combines L1 and L2 regularization, useful for feature selection and handling multicollinearity, especially with many features.

4. **ElasticNetCV**:
   - **Why Used**: Automates finding optimal parameters for L1 and L2 regularization through cross-validation, ensuring a robust model.

5. **BayesianRidge**:
   - **Why Used**: Provides a probabilistic approach to regression with uncertainty estimates, useful for understanding prediction reliability.

6. **HuberRegressor**:
   - **Why Used**: Robust to outliers, using the Huber loss function to reduce their impact on model predictions.

### Tree-Based and Ensemble Models
1. **Random Forest**:
   - **Why Used**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy and controls overfitting, performing well on various datasets.

2. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - **Why Used**: Sequentially builds models, each correcting errors of the previous ones, resulting in highly accurate predictions.

### Support Vector Machine
3. **SVR (Support Vector Regressor)**:
   - **Why Used**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, useful for non-linear relationships between features and target.

### Extreme Gradient Boosting
4. **XGBoost**:
   - **Why Used**: Efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting, known for performance and speed.
